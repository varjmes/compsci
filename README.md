# James teaches themself Computer Science! :seedling:

I have been a professional programmer for over 4 years. I am self taught, I have no degree in
Comp Sci but do have one in Psychology. I want to teach myself Computer Science because I feel
best when I am learning something new and I believe that learning core CS will help me in my career!

I am currently following the [OSSU Computer Science curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science),
the course says it can be completed in two years if you spend 20 hours a week on it. Knowing myself
(yay ADHD) it is unlikely I will stick to the course, but it's a great start. I'm not committing a
set amount of time but the more I enjoy something, the more time I spend on it.

This repo is going to be a dumping ground for the solutions to courseware programming challenges,
do not expect these to be clean and concise and the best code: the course challenges ask you to
do things in a certain way usually against what I'd write naturally in my day to day life.
